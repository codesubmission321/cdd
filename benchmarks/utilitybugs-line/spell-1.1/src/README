GNU Spell is a clone of standard Unix `spell', implemented as a
wrapper to Ispell.  Therefore you must install Ispell before Spell
will work.  To learn how to install Spell, see the file `INSTALL'.

Please send bug reports to `bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  See the
section "Problems" in the Spell manual for more information.

Spell is free software.  See the file `COPYING' for copying
conditions.
