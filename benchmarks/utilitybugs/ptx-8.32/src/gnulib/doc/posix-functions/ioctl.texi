Gnulib module: ioctl

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), @code{ioctl} is called
@code{ioctlsocket}, and error codes from this function are not placed in
@code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be used instead.
@item
The second parameter is of type @code{unsigned long} rather than @code{int}
on some platforms:
glibc 2.26, Mac OS X 10.13, FreeBSD 11.0, NetBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 6.0, Haiku 2017.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
